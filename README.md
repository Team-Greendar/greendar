## 💡Idea of making Greendar
 If you look at the calendar with your busy schedule, there are many small anniversaries, such as World Forest Day on March 21, World Honeybee Day on March 20, and International Clean Air Day on July 7. But this day often passes by without even knowing what kind of day it is, what it is doing, or what it is for.

 We think we should change the indifference of urban people to the environment first. In order for people's perceptions to change that much, environmental problems must permeate our daily lives and get used to them. As if we all had a hard time wearing masks in the early days of COVID-19, but now we wear them habitually, and now we are used to them and don't want to take them off.

 In other words, it is not easy for people living in our city to worry about other additional problems because their daily lives are busy. So I thought it would be nice to have a service for busy city people, a service that specifically tells them when and how to act to alleviate environmental problems, and a service that can melt into their daily lives.
